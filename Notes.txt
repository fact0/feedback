Time taken: about 7 hours

improvements:

some styling things but not a big deal, stop using the hero layout ive made, confirmation for deleting things using a modal, easier way to add admin accounts.

try the email password recovery mentioned in the further study

clean up redundant code

add a couple more tests, how to test if something is still in the database or still in session.
